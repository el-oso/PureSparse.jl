# Every default here carries a derivation comment (design.md §3.5) rather than being a
# bare literal — required even though these aren't hardware-cache-derived like PureBLAS's

# Relaxed-amalgamation merged-width tiers (design.md §3.5). Narrower than
# `amalg_cols[1]`: PureBLAS's Float64 microkernel register tile is ~8 columns wide, so
# blocks below that waste the kernel regardless of density — merge nearly always
# (amalg_zmax[1] high). Between tiers 1-2: update flops scale ~quadratically in width, so
# a zero-fraction z inflates flops by roughly 1/(1-z)^2 on the padded block. Above tier 2:
# wide panels already run near peak; padding is pure loss, and panel growth starts
# pressuring the update-buffer's cache residency, so only near-nesting qualifies.
#
# **Empirically recalibrated (2026-07-13, ROADMAP task 7b') against the exact
# union-height row estimate**, superseding the original starting-point numbers above —
# the previous defaults (`(8,32,128)`/`(0.9,0.15,0.03)`) were picked before
# `relaxed_amalgamation` could iterate to a fixpoint (design §3.5's old single-pass
# version); once the estimate feeding the z-test is exact instead of a proxy (see the
# `relaxed_amalgamation` docstring, src/symbolic/supernodes.jl), those thresholds turned
# out to systematically UNDER-merge on the gate matrices (M1 task 8's actual benchmark
# pass): a Chairmarks sweep of the M1 wall-time gate's warm-refactor arm over
# `amalg_zmax ∈ {(0.9,0.15,0.03), (0.95,0.3,0.08), (0.97,0.35,0.08), (0.98,0.4,0.1)}` ×
# `amalg_cols ∈ {(8,32,128), (16,64,128), (16,64,256)}` found the ORIGINAL tiers gave
# 4/14 gate passes (regressed from the prior single-pass algorithm's 6/14 — over-tight
# thresholds fragmented already-good structure), while doubling the column tiers to
# `(16,64,128)` and loosening z to `(0.97,0.35,0.08)` (deliberately the SAME zmax point
# already probed and reported as "far more permissive" in the prior child-ordering
# session, reused here rather than re-derived from scratch) restored solid PASSes on
# every banded and Laplacian gate row while leaving small unstructured-random cases
# (n<=1000) at a noise-level tie — those were already at or near CHOLMOD's per-call-
# overhead floor before any of this work (design's fixed cost is unrelated to supernode
# shape at that scale). Doubling `amalg_cols` is the free-tunable half of this
# recalibration: the exact height estimate now lets multi-child cascaded merges reach
# useful widths that the original single-microkernel-tile-anchored cap would truncate
# mid-cascade, so a wider cap gives the fixpoint loop room to actually converge on a
# BLAS-3-efficient block before hitting the next tier's zero-fraction wall. No
# correctness weight attaches to any of these numbers — only to the §3.4 superset
# invariant (checked independently in tests), and this remains a swept starting point,
# not a hardware- or paper-derived constant (see the numbered rationale in design §3.5's
# table, unchanged conceptually — only the calibration below it moved).
